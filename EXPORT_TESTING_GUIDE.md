4. Check results and error messages in the panel

### Method 2: Browser Console Testing
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Navigate to the Unified Reports page
3. Copy and paste the contents of `test-export-frontend.js` into the console
4. Run `exportFrontendTest.quickTest()` for a quick check
5. Run `exportFrontendTest.runComprehensiveTest()` for full testing

### Method 3: Manual UI Testing
1. Navigate to the Unified Reports page
2. Wait for data to load
3. Click the export dropdown menu
4. Test each export option:
   - Export with Template (opens template selector)

- ✅ All templates are available and selectable
- ✅ All formats work for each template
- ✅ Generated files have proper formatting and data
- ✅ Template variables are properly replaced with data

### Scenario 4: Error Handling Test
**User Role**: Any user
**Expected Behavior**: Graceful error handling and user feedback

**Steps**:
1. Test export with no data available
2. Test export with invalid permissions
3. Test export with network issues (simulate offline)
4. Test export with corrupted template data

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Clear error messages displayed to user
- ✅ No application crashes or blank screens
- ✅ Proper fallback behavior
- ✅ Loading states and progress indicators work

### Scenario 5: Performance Test
**User Role**: Administrator (for large datasets)
**Expected Behavior**: Reasonable performance with large datasets

**Steps**:
1. Generate or use large dataset (1000+ complaints)
2. Apply complex filters
3. Test export in all formats
4. Monitor performance and memory usage

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Export completes within reasonable time (< 30 seconds)
- ✅ No memory leaks or browser freezing
- ✅ Progress indicators show during processing
- ✅ Large files download successfully

## Diagnostic Tools

### Built-in Diagnostics
Run these commands in the browser console:

```javascript
// Quick system health check
exportDiagnostics.log()

// Download detailed diagnostic report
exportDiagnostics.download()

// Run comprehensive export tests
exportTests.runAllExportTests()
```

### Manual Checks

#### Template Availability
1. Check that templates exist in `public/templates/export/`
2. Verify template content is valid HTML
3. Confirm template variables match data structure

#### Library Dependencies
1. Verify html2pdf.js is loaded for PDF exports
2. Verify XLSX library is loaded for Excel exports
3. Check browser console for library loading errors

#### Data Flow
1. Confirm analytics data is loaded in dashboard
2. Verify data preparation functions work correctly
3. Check template rendering produces valid output

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Export Button Not Working
**Symptoms**: Button click has no effect
**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify user has export permissions
3. Ensure analytics data is loaded
4. Run diagnostic tests to identify specific issue

### Issue: Empty Export Files
**Symptoms**: Downloaded file is blank or contains no data
**Solutions**:
1. Verify analytics data is available and properly formatted
2. Check template data preparation in browser console
3. Ensure template variables match data structure
4. Run template rendering test

### Issue: Permission Denied Errors
**Symptoms**: Error messages about insufficient permissions
**Solutions**:
1. Verify user role and ward assignments
2. Check RBAC validation logic
3. Ensure proper authentication tokens
4. Test with different user roles

### Issue: Template Not Found Errors
**Symptoms**: Error messages about missing templates
**Solutions**:
1. Verify template files exist in `public/templates/export/`
