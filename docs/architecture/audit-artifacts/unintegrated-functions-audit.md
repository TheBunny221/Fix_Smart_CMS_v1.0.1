# Unintegrated Functions Audit (Synchronized)

**Last synced:** 2025-09-24  
**Source of truth:** [`docs/UNINTEGRATED_FUNCTIONS.md`](../../UNINTEGRATED_FUNCTIONS.md)

This artifact mirrors the consolidated integration report maintained at the root of the documentation set. The previous autogenerated placeholder overstated the number of open issues and referenced code that no longer exists. The section below captures the verified state for architectural context.

## Summary

- ✅ Authentication base query uses the hardened `baseQueryWithReauth`; no missing imports remain.
- ✅ Complaint attachments are serviced by both `/complaints/:id/attachments` and `/uploads/complaint/:id/attachment`, delegating to the same controller.
- ✅ Dashboard utilities (`formatDate`, `getComplaintTypeLabel`, `isResolved`) are shared from `client/lib` and actively imported.
- ⚠️ `/api/auth/refresh` is still absent on the Express server even though an RTK Query hook exists.
- ⚠️ Legacy `createAsyncThunk` slices (complaints, guest) coexist with RTK Query endpoints.
- ⚠️ Helper shells (`RoleSwitcher.tsx`, `OptimizedComponents.tsx`, `UXComponents.tsx`) are unreferenced and should be cleaned up or documented.

For the full matrix of endpoints, dashboard notes, and component inventory, refer to the master report linked above.
