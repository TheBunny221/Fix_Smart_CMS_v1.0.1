# UNINTEGRATED FUNCTIONS AUDIT REPORT

**Generated on:** 2025-09-24
**Audit Type:** Comprehensive Frontend-Backend Integration Analysis
**System:** Smart City CMS - Cochin Municipal Corporation

## Executive Summary

The September 2025 reconciliation confirms that the majority of previously flagged integration gaps have been addressed. The RTK Query base configuration, complaint attachment workflow, and dashboard utilities now align with the running codebase. Remaining work is concentrated around hardening token lifecycle management, consolidating the dual Redux patterns that still exist for historic screens, and pruning legacy helper components that are no longer referenced.

### Current Integration Posture

| Status            | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Stable         | RTK Query base query, complaint upload compatibility, dashboard utilities    |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs follow-up | Refresh-token endpoint, legacy Redux thunks, unused dashboard helper shells |
| üß™ In Progress    | Comprehensive automated test execution (type errors still block a clean run) |

---

## ‚úÖ Recently Verified Fixes

1. **Authentication Base Query** ‚Äì `client/store/api/baseApi.ts` now exports a single `baseApi` configured with the hardened `baseQueryWithReauth`, and the runtime no longer references the previously missing `toast`/`setError` imports.
2. **Complaint Attachment Compatibility** ‚Äì Both the historical `POST /complaints/:id/attachments` alias and the modern `/uploads/complaint/:complaintId/attachment` route are wired to the same controller, ensuring upload parity regardless of the entry point.
3. **Dashboard Utilities** ‚Äì `client/pages/CitizenDashboard.tsx` now imports the shared helpers from `client/lib/dateUtils.ts` and `client/lib/complaintUtils.ts`, removing the undefined function calls that previously blocked rendering.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Work Items

| Area                          | Detail                                                                                                          | Recommended Action |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Token lifecycle               | Frontend exposes `useRefreshTokenMutation` but the Express app does not implement `/api/auth/refresh`.          | Implement refresh route or remove unused hook. |
| Legacy Redux thunks           | `complaintsSlice`, `guestSlice`, and admin workflows still depend on custom `apiCall` thunks alongside RTK Query.| Migrate legacy slices to RTK Query for consistency. |
| Unused helper components      | `RoleSwitcher.tsx`, `OptimizedComponents.tsx`, and `UXComponents.tsx` remain unreferenced by any page.           | Remove or integrate intentionally. |
| Automated verification debt   | `npm run typecheck` reports existing issues unrelated to this audit, blocking green CI.                          | Resolve outstanding TypeScript errors before enabling automated docs checks. |

## üîó API Endpoint Status

| Frontend Call                                         | Backend Handler / Notes                                         | Status |

| `POST /auth/refresh`                                  | **Missing** ‚Äì hook defined client-side but no Express route.      | ‚ö†Ô∏è     |
| `GET /complaints`, `POST /complaints`, `PUT /complaints/:id/(status|assign)` | Served by `server/routes/complaintRoutes.js`.                    | ‚úÖ     |
| `POST /complaints/:id/attachments`                    | Alias to `uploadComplaintAttachment`; mirrors `/uploads/...`.     | ‚úÖ     |
| `GET /complaints/ward-dashboard-stats`                | Implemented for ward officers in `complaintRoutes.js`.           | ‚úÖ     |
| `POST /guest/complaint`, `GET /guest/track/:id`, `GET /guest/stats` | Backed by `guestRoutes.js`.                                      | ‚úÖ     |

## üìä Dashboard Integration Notes

### Citizen Dashboard
- Uses RTK Query hooks for list and statistics (`useGetComplaintsQuery`, `useGetComplaintStatisticsQuery`).
- Utility helpers sourced from `client/lib` modules; no missing imports remain.

### Admin & Maintenance Dashboards
- Continue to rely on Redux thunks defined in `client/store/slices/complaintsSlice.ts` and related slices, creating a mixed data layer. Migration remains outstanding.

### Ward Officer Workflows
- Consume `/complaints/ward-dashboard-stats` (server alias confirmed) instead of the older `/wards/:id/stats` route cited in legacy docs.
