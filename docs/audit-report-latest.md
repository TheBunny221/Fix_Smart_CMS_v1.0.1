# Documentation Audit – September 2025

**Generated:** 2025-09-24  
**Scope:** `docs/` markdown review, integration validation, link and content refresh

---

## Summary

- ✅ Reconciled integration documentation (`UNINTEGRATED_FUNCTIONS.md`, `CODE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `INTEGRATION_FIXES_PR.md`) with the current codebase.  
- ✅ Updated architectural artifacts under `docs/architecture/audit-artifacts` to reference the synchronized reports instead of stale autogenerated copies.  
- ✅ Clarified `UI_COMPONENT_MAP.md` to reflect the active `ErrorBoundary` implementation.  
- ✅ Extended `docs/README.md` with an audit and integration index for quick navigation.  
- ⚠️ Added backlog notes for unresolved items: missing `/api/auth/refresh`, legacy Redux thunks, unused helper components, and failing `npm run typecheck`.

## Fixed Issues

| Area                              | Resolution |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Outdated integration counts       | Replaced templated audit text with verified findings that match the live code. |
| Attachment endpoint mismatch note | Documented the Express alias that forwards `/complaints/:id/attachments` to the upload controller. |
| Missing utility references        | Confirmed shared helpers in `client/lib` and updated docs accordingly. |
| ErrorBoundary caution flag        | Reframed as an active component with documented behavior. |
| Doc duplication in architecture artifacts | Converted files into synchronized snapshots pointing at the updated primary reports. |

## Outstanding Items (Require Engineering Work)

1. Implement (or formally remove) the `/api/auth/refresh` endpoint to match the generated RTK Query mutation.  
2. Migrate legacy `createAsyncThunk` slices (complaints, guest, admin) to RTK Query for a unified data layer.  
3. Prune or document dormant helper components: `RoleSwitcher.tsx`, `OptimizedComponents.tsx`, `UXComponents.tsx`.  
4. Address the pre-existing TypeScript errors so that `npm run typecheck` can pass as part of routine documentation audits.

---

## Follow-Up Recommendations

- Schedule a backend task for refresh-token support or update the frontend to drop the unused mutation.
- Plan a staged migration of thunk-based slices, prioritizing high-traffic dashboards.
- Introduce a lightweight Markdown lint step once TypeScript errors are resolved to keep docs continuously validated.
