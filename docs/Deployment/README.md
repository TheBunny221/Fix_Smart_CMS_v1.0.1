## Prerequisites

Before following any deployment guide, ensure you have:

- [ ] Completed local development setup (see [Onboarding Documentation](../Onboarding/README.md))
- [ ] Understanding of system configuration (see [System Documentation](../System/README.md))
- [ ] Database setup knowledge (see [Database Documentation](../Database/README.md))
- [ ] Basic knowledge of the target deployment platform

## Support and Troubleshooting

For deployment issues and troubleshooting:

1. Check the specific platform guide for common issues
2. Review [System Configuration](../System/system_config_overview.md) for configuration problems
3. Consult [Database Migration Guidelines](../Database/migration_guidelines.md) for database-related issues
4. See [Developer Documentation](../Developer/README.md) for application-specific problems
