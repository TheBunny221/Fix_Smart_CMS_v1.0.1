# Complaint Types Chart Fix

## Issue
The "Complaints by Type" chart in the admin dashboard was showing "Unknown (0)" instead of actual complaint type names.

## Root Cause
The system was using the legacy `type` field (string) instead of the new `ComplaintType` model relationship, and there were issues with null/empty values being displayed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Admin Controller (`server/controller/adminController.js`)
- Modified the complaints by type query to use both `complaintTypeId` (new) and `type` (legacy) fields
- **Added deduplication logic** to prevent duplicate complaint types from appearing
- Added comprehensive filtering to exclude null, empty, and zero-value entries
- Added proper error handling and debugging
- Improved the `getTypeColor` function to handle different naming conventions
- Added `cleanTypeName` helper function to sanitize type names
- Added fallback logic for when no data is available
- **Prioritizes ComplaintType model data over legacy string data** when duplicates exist

### 2. Updated Frontend (`client/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`)
- Added client-side filtering to exclude entries with zero values
- Improved PieChart data filtering to only show valid entries
- Enhanced legend display to hide empty/invalid entries
- Updated debug information to show filtered counts

### 3. Created Test Data Scripts
- `server/scripts/seedComplaintTypes.js` - Seeds default complaint types
- `server/scripts/createTestData.js` - Creates test complaint types and complaints

### 4. Added Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "seed:complaint-types": "node server/scripts/seedComplaintTypes.js",
  "seed:test-data": "node server/scripts/createTestData.js"
}
```

## How to Fix the Issue

### Option 1: Create Complaint Types via Admin Interface
1. Go to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí System Config ‚Üí Complaint Types
2. Create complaint types with proper names and SLA hours
3. Refresh the dashboard

### Option 2: Run the Seeding Scripts
```bash
# Create default complaint types
npm run seed:complaint-types

# Or create both types and test complaints
npm run seed:test-data
```

### Option 3: Manual Database Update
If you have existing complaints with legacy `type` values, you can:
1. Create complaint types in the admin interface
2. Update existing complaints to link to the new complaint types

## Expected Result
After implementing the fix, the "Complaints by Type" chart should show:
- Proper complaint type names (e.g., "Water Supply", "Electricity")
- Correct counts for each type
- Appropriate colors for each segment

## Debugging
The controller now includes extensive logging. Check the server console for:
- `üìä Complaints by type debug:` - Shows query results
- `‚úÖ Sending complaints by type data:` - Shows final data sent to client
- `üîç Database check` - Shows database state when no data is found

## Technical Details
The fix handles three scenarios:
1. **New approach**: Complaints linked via `complaintTypeId` to `ComplaintType` table
2. **Legacy approach**: Complaints using string `type` field
3. **Fallback**: Empty state with default complaint types

### Deduplication Strategy
To prevent duplicate complaint types from appearing in the chart:
1. **Priority System**: ComplaintType model data takes precedence over legacy string data
2. **Case-insensitive matching**: "Water Supply" and "WATER_SUPPLY" are treated as the same type
3. **Count aggregation**: If duplicates are found, their counts are combined
4. **Two-level deduplication**: 
   - First at the database query level (prevents mixing new and legacy for same type)
   - Second at the final data preparation level (ensures no duplicates reach the frontend)

The system now gracefully handles all three cases and provides meaningful, deduplicated data to the chart.
