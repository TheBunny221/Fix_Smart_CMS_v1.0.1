# Authorization Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The authorization middleware was receiving an array of roles instead of individual role arguments, causing all requests to be rejected with a 403 error.

## Root Cause
The `authorize` middleware is designed to accept spread arguments:
```javascript
export const authorize = (...roles) => {
  // roles is an array of individual arguments
  if (!roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
    // This check fails when roles is [["ADMIN", "WARD_OFFICER"]] instead of ["ADMIN", "WARD_OFFICER"]
  }
}
```

But the routes were calling it with an array:
```javascript
// INCORRECT - passes array as first argument
authorize(["ADMINISTRATOR", "WARD_OFFICER"])

// CORRECT - passes individual arguments
authorize("ADMINISTRATOR", "WARD_OFFICER")
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `/unified` Route
```javascript
// Before
authorize(["ADMINISTRATOR", "WARD_OFFICER", "MAINTENANCE_TEAM", "CITIZEN"])

// After  
authorize("ADMINISTRATOR", "WARD_OFFICER", "MAINTENANCE_TEAM", "CITIZEN")
```

### 2. Fixed `/analytics` Route
```javascript
// Before
authorize(["ADMINISTRATOR", "WARD_OFFICER", "MAINTENANCE_TEAM"])

// After
authorize("ADMINISTRATOR", "WARD_OFFICER", "MAINTENANCE_TEAM")
```

### 3. Fixed `/export` Route
```javascript
// Before
authorize(["ADMINISTRATOR", "WARD_OFFICER"])

// After
authorize("ADMINISTRATOR", "WARD_OFFICER")
```

### 4. Fixed `/heatmap` Route
```javascript
// Before
authorize(["ADMINISTRATOR", "WARD_OFFICER", "MAINTENANCE_TEAM"])

// After
authorize("ADMINISTRATOR", "WARD_OFFICER", "MAINTENANCE_TEAM")
```

### 5. Fixed `/health` Route
```javascript
// Before
authorize(["ADMINISTRATOR"])

// After
authorize("ADMINISTRATOR")
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For ADMINISTRATOR Role
- ✅ Should have access to all routes: `/unified`, `/analytics`, `/export`, `/heatmap`, `/health`
- ✅ Should receive proper data responses instead of 403 errors

### For WARD_OFFICER Role  
- ✅ Should have access to: `/unified`, `/analytics`, `/export`, `/heatmap`
- ❌ Should be denied access to: `/health`

### For MAINTENANCE_TEAM Role
- ✅ Should have access to: `/unified`, `/analytics`, `/heatmap`  
- ❌ Should be denied access to: `/export`, `/health`

### For CITIZEN Role
- ✅ Should have access to: `/unified`
- ❌ Should be denied access to: `/analytics`, `/export`, `/heatmap`, `/health`

## Testing Steps

1. **Test as ADMINISTRATOR**:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
        http://localhost:3000/api/reports-revamped/unified
   ```
   Expected: 200 OK with analytics data

2. **Test as WARD_OFFICER**:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ward_officer_token>" \
        http://localhost:3000/api/reports-revamped/export?format=csv
   ```
   Expected: 200 OK with CSV file

3. **Test as MAINTENANCE_TEAM**:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <maintenance_token>" \
        http://localhost:3000/api/reports-revamped/export?format=csv
   ```
   Expected: 403 Forbidden

4. **Test as CITIZEN**:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <citizen_token>" \
        http://localhost:3000/api/reports-revamped/analytics
   ```
   Expected: 403 Forbidden

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] ADMINISTRATOR can access unified reports
- [ ] ADMINISTRATOR can export reports  
- [ ] WARD_OFFICER can access analytics but not health endpoint
- [ ] MAINTENANCE_TEAM cannot access export endpoint
- [ ] CITIZEN can only access unified endpoint
- [ ] All 403 errors now show proper role-based messages

## Additional Notes

- This was a simple syntax error that caused all authorization to fail
- The middleware itself was working correctly
- No changes needed to the authorization logic, just the function calls
- This fix should resolve the "unauthorized" errors for all valid user roles

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Add TypeScript types for the authorize middleware
2. Create unit tests for authorization middleware
3. Add integration tests for all route permissions
4. Consider using a more explicit authorization pattern
