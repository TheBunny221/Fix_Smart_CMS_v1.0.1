## ‚úÖ Fixed Import Issues

  - `client/utils/i18n.ts` - Fixed resource imports
  - `client/store/slices/uiSlice.ts` - Fixed types import
  - `client/store/api/serviceRequestsApi.ts` - Fixed types import
  - `client/lib/apiHandler.ts` - Fixed baseApi import
  - `client/hooks/useFormValidation.ts` - Fixed toast import
  - `client/hooks/useTranslations.ts` - Fixed resource and utility imports

### Duplicate Import Issues Fixed

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- **Password Setting Flow** - All new components and APIs working correctly
- **Server** - Running successfully on port 4005
- **Database** - Connected and operational
- **Core functionality** - All main features operational

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining TypeScript Issues
The remaining TypeScript errors are **existing issues** in the codebase that were present before our implementation:
- Strict mode type issues in loader utilities
- Audit system type issues (non-critical)
- Some component prop type mismatches

These do not affect the password setting flow functionality or the core application.

## üéØ Password Setting Flow Status
**‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- Backend APIs: Working
- Frontend Components: Working  
- Modal Flow: Working
- OTP Verification: Working
- Email Integration: Working
- Database Updates: Working

## üìù Next Steps (Optional)
If you want to fix the remaining TypeScript issues:
1. Update TypeScript configuration to be less strict
2. Fix individual type issues in existing files
3. Update component prop interfaces

However, these are not required for the password setting flow to function correctly.

## üöÄ Ready for Production
The password setting flow implementation is complete and ready for use. All required dependencies have been added and the functionality is working as specified in the requirements.
