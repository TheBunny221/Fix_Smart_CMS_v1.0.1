## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Decision Criteria

Initiate rollback if any of the following occur:
- Critical functionality is broken
- Error rates exceed 5% of normal levels
- Performance degrades by more than 50%
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- Data integrity issues are detected

### Rollback Process

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Stop Traffic** - Enable maintenance mode or redirect traffic
2. **Assess Impact** - Determine scope of issues and affected users
3. **Execute Rollback** - Follow documented rollback procedures
4. **Validate Rollback** - Ensure previous version is fully operational
5. **Communicate Status** - Notify stakeholders of rollback completion

#### Rollback Steps
- [ ] Enable maintenance mode
- [ ] Stop application services
- [ ] Restore previous application version
- [ ] Rollback database migrations (if safe)
- [ ] Restore configuration files
- [ ] Restart services and validate functionality
- [ ] Disable maintenance mode
- [ ] Monitor system stability

### Post-Rollback Activities

#### Investigation
- [ ] Document all issues encountered
- [ ] Analyze root causes of problems
- [ ] Identify process improvements
- [ ] Update rollback procedures if needed
- [ ] Plan remediation for next deployment attempt

#### Communication
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of rollback completion
- [ ] Provide timeline for issue resolution
- [ ] Update status pages and communication channels
- [ ] Schedule post-mortem meeting
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## Environment-Specific Validation
