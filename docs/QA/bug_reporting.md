#### Medium
- Minor functionality issues
- Cosmetic problems that affect usability
- Performance issues affecting individual users
- Non-critical features not working properly

**Examples**:
- Form validation messages unclear

- Slow loading of non-critical components
- Optional features not working

#### Low
- Cosmetic issues with minimal impact
- Enhancement requests
- Documentation errors
- Minor usability improvements

**Examples**:
- Text formatting inconsistencies
- Color scheme improvements
- Tooltip text corrections
- Minor accessibility improvements

### Priority Levels

#### P1 (Immediate)
- Must be fixed before next release
- Blocking critical functionality
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data integrity issues

#### P2 (High)
- Should be fixed in current sprint
- Important functionality affected
- Significant user impact
- Performance degradation

#### P3 (Medium)
- Can be scheduled for upcoming sprint
- Moderate user impact
- Non-critical functionality
- Usability improvements

#### P4 (Low)
- Can be addressed in future releases
- Minimal user impact
- Enhancement requests
- Documentation updates

## Bug Lifecycle

### Status Definitions

1. **New** - Bug reported and awaiting triage
2. **Triaged** - Bug reviewed and assigned priority/severity
3. **Assigned** - Bug assigned to developer/team
4. **In Progress** - Developer actively working on fix
5. **Fixed** - Developer completed fix, awaiting testing
6. **Testing** - QA team validating the fix
7. **Resolved** - Fix validated and ready for release
8. **Closed** - Fix deployed and verified in production
9. **Reopened** - Issue reoccurred or fix was insufficient

## Communication Guidelines

### Internal Communication
- **Daily Updates**: Critical and high-priority bugs
- **Weekly Reports**: Overall bug status and trends
- **Release Notes**: Include fixed bugs in release documentation
- **Post-Mortem**: Analyze critical bugs and process improvements

### External Communication
- **User Notifications**: Inform users of known issues and workarounds
- **Status Updates**: Regular updates on fix progress for critical issues
- **Release Notes**: Communicate bug fixes to end users
- **Support Documentation**: Update help documentation with known issues

## Best Practices

### For Bug Reporters
1. **Be Specific**: Provide exact steps and clear descriptions
2. **Include Context**: Environment, user role, and system state
3. **Attach Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, and error messages
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify reproduction steps before submitting
5. **Follow Up**: Provide additional information when requested

### For Developers
1. **Acknowledge Quickly**: Respond to bug assignments promptly
2. **Ask Questions**: Request clarification when needed
3. **Document Fixes**: Explain what was changed and why
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify fix doesn't introduce new issues
5. **Update Status**: Keep bug status current throughout development

### For QA Team
1. **Verify Reproduction**: Confirm bug exists before assignment
2. **Test Fixes Thoroughly**: Validate fixes in multiple scenarios
3. **Regression Testing**: Ensure fixes don't break existing functionality
4. **Document Results**: Provide clear pass/fail criteria
5. **Close Properly**: Verify fixes in production before closing
