# üîß Integration Hardening Status - Smart City CMS

## Summary

This note updates the historic ‚ÄúCritical Integration Fixes‚Äù narrative to match the current repository. The original write-up referenced missing imports and absent upload aliases that have since been resolved. The sections below capture the actual state of the fixes and remaining work as of 2025-09-24.

## ‚úÖ Completed Improvements

1. **RTK Query Base API**  
   - `client/store/api/baseApi.ts` now exports a single `baseApi` constructed with `baseQueryWithReauth`.  
   - The fetch wrapper handles logout on 401 responses without relying on missing `toast` or `setError` imports.

2. **Complaint Attachment Flow**  
   - `server/routes/complaintRoutes.js` forwards `POST /complaints/:id/attachments` to the same controller used by `/uploads/complaint/:complaintId/attachment`.  
   - Frontend mutations may call either path without breaking compatibility.

3. **Shared Dashboard Utilities**  
   - `client/lib/dateUtils.ts` and `client/lib/complaintUtils.ts` supply `formatDate`, `getComplaintTypeLabel`, and `isResolved`.  
   - `client/pages/CitizenDashboard.tsx` imports these helpers directly, eliminating undefined references.

4. **Testing Tooling**  
   - Required dependencies (`jsdom`, `@testing-library/*`, `msw`, `@vitest/ui`) remain listed in `package.json`.  
   - Test execution is still gated by outstanding TypeScript errors, tracked separately in the audit report.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Still Open

- `/api/auth/refresh` is not defined on the Express server even though `authApi` exposes `useRefreshTokenMutation`.  
- Several dashboards continue to depend on legacy Redux thunks; migration to RTK Query is recommended.  
- Helper shells (`RoleSwitcher.tsx`, `OptimizedComponents.tsx`, `UXComponents.tsx`) remain unused and should be cleaned up or documented.

## üß™ Testing Status

- `npm run lint` ‚Äì scheduled after documentation changes to ensure no repo-wide regressions.  
- `npm run typecheck` ‚Äì currently fails due to pre-existing errors; fixing them is outside the scope of this doc refresh but remains on the audit backlog.

## Next Steps

1. Implement or remove the refresh-token endpoint to align backend capability with the generated RTK Query hook.  
2. Plan a gradual migration away from the bespoke `apiCall` helpers towards unified RTK Query endpoints.  
3. Prune or document unused helper components to keep future audits focused on live code.
