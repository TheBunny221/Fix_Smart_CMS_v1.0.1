# System Configuration UI Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully fixed and organized the System Configuration UI in AdminConfig.tsx to resolve duplicate fields, improve layout, and enhance user experience.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Duplicate Field Rendering
- **Problem**: Multiple sections were rendering the same configuration fields due to repeated entries and incorrect mapping
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed all duplicate sections and consolidated into organized categories
  - Implemented `renderConfigurationSection()` helper function to avoid duplication
  - Added logic to skip duplicate maintenance mode settings (MAINTENANCE_MODE vs SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE)

### 2. Poor Organization and Layout
- **Problem**: Settings were scattered across different sections without logical grouping
- **Solution**: Organized settings into 6 logical categories:
  - **Application Settings**: APP_NAME, APP_LOGO_URL, APP_LOGO_SIZE, SYSTEM_VE
