# CODE AUDIT REPORT - Smart City CMS

**Audit Date:** 2025-09-24
**System:** Smart City Complaint Management System
**Scope:** Frontend ⇄ Backend integration baseline
**Auditor:** Documentation refresh (automated + manual verification)

---

## Executive Summary

The September 2025 review reconciles the documentation set with the current codebase. Earlier blockers—missing RTK Query imports, undefined dashboard utilities, and the complaint attachment mismatch—are no longer reproducible. The platform now ships with a hardened RTK Query base query, dual complaint upload entry points, and shared utility helpers in active use. Remaining integration risks are centered on lifecycle hygiene (refresh token endpoint), the coexistence of legacy thunks with RTK Query slices, and dormant helper components that inflate maintenance overhead.

### Health Snapshot

| Area                     | Status  | Notes |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ----- |
| Authentication           | ✅ Good | Custom `baseQueryWithReauth` handles failures and logout fallbacks. |
| Complaints & Attachments | ✅ Good | Alias under `/complaints/:id/attachments` points to the same controller as `/uploads/...`. |
| Guest Flows              | ✅ Good | Guest endpoints map 1:1 with Express routes. |
| Token Refresh            | ⚠️ Open | No `/api/auth/refresh` route despite generated RTK hook. |
| State Management         | ⚠️ Open | Legacy `createAsyncThunk` flows (complaints, guest) coexist with RTK Query. |
| Test Automation          | ⚠️ Open | `npm run typecheck` still reports pre-existing TypeScript errors. |

## Verified Fixes Since Last Audit

1. **Base API Configuration** – `client/store/api/baseApi.ts` is consolidated around `baseQueryWithReauth`, with redundant imports removed and robust fetch handling in place.
2. **Complaint Attachments** – `server/routes/complaintRoutes.js` exposes a compatibility alias for `/complaints/:id/attachments`, delegating to the same controller as `/uploads/complaint/:complaintId/attachment` defined in `server/routes/uploadRoutes.js`.
3. **Dashboard Utilities** – Citizen dashboard components import `formatDate`, `getComplaintTypeLabel`, and `isResolved` from the shared `client/lib` helpers instead of duplicating logic.
4. **Documentation Sync** – `docs/UNINTEGRATED_FUNCTIONS.md` and architecture artifacts now reflect the actual runtime wiring and component usage.

## Outstanding High-Priority Items

| Item                                   | Impact                                                                 | Suggested Next Step |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `/api/auth/refresh` implementation     | Without the route the RTK hook cannot renew sessions automatically.    | Add Express handler or remove unused hook. |
| Legacy Redux slices (`complaints`, `guest`) | Dual data layers increase code drift and onboarding friction.          | Plan phased migration to RTK Query. |
| Dormant helper components              | `RoleSwitcher.tsx`, `OptimizedComponents.tsx`, `UXComponents.tsx` add noise to audits. | Remove or document intended usage. |
| TypeScript regression debt             | `npm run typecheck` fails because of unrelated, existing errors.       | Address failing declarations before enabling automated doc linting. |

| Feature Area        | Frontend Entry Points                                               | Backend Routes Confirmed                    | Status |

| Authentication      | `/auth/login`, `/auth/login-otp`, `/auth/verify-otp`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/me` | `server/routes/authRoutes.js`               | ✅     |
| Token Refresh       | `/auth/refresh` (RTK mutation only)                                 | _Not implemented_                           | ⚠️     |
| Complaints          | `/complaints`, `/complaints/:id`, `/complaints/:id/(status|assign)` | `server/routes/complaintRoutes.js`          | ✅     |
| Complaint Attachments | `/complaints/:id/attachments`, `/uploads/complaint/:id/attachment`  | `server/routes/complaintRoutes.js`, `server/routes/uploadRoutes.js` | ✅ |
| Ward Dashboard      | `/complaints/ward-dashboard-stats`                                   | `server/routes/complaintRoutes.js`          | ✅     |
| Guest Portal        | `/guest/complaint`, `/guest/track/:id`, `/guest/stats`               | `server/routes/guestRoutes.js`              | ✅     |

## Component Health

| Component                             | Status  | Notes |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| `client/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` | ✅ Active | Handles render failures with reload affordance. |
| `client/components/FeedbackDialog.tsx`| ✅ Active | Imported by `CitizenDashboard.tsx`. |
| `client/components/RoleSwitcher.tsx`  | ⚠️ Idle  | Not imported by any route. |
| `client/components/OptimizedComponents.tsx` | ⚠️ Idle | Placeholder with no consumers. |
| `client/components/UXComponents.tsx`  | ⚠️ Idle  | Placeholder with no consumers. |

## Testing Status

- `npm run typecheck` → Fails because of existing TypeScript declaration issues unrelated to this doc sweep.
- `npm run lint` → To be executed after documentation updates to ensure repo-wide standards remain intact.
- No automated regression tests were modified; executing them after the outstanding TypeScript fixes is recommended.

---

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize implementation (or removal) of the refresh-token endpoint to align code with generated client hooks.
2. Draft a migration plan for the remaining `createAsyncThunk` flows into RTK Query to unify data fetching.
3. Schedule cleanup of dormant helper components to reduce confusion during future audits.
4. Resolve failing TypeScript declarations so that type-checking can be part of continuous documentation validation.
