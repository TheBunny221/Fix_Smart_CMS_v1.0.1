# Code Audit Report (Synchronized)

**Last synced:** 2025-09-24  
**Source of truth:** [`docs/CODE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`](../../CODE_AUDIT_REPORT.md)

The original scaffold in this location duplicated outdated findings. This snapshot now tracks the authoritative audit summary maintained alongside the rest of the documentation set.

## Key Updates

- ✅ RTK Query base configuration verified (`baseQueryWithReauth` in `client/store/api/baseApi.ts`).
- ✅ Complaint attachment alias confirmed in `server/routes/complaintRoutes.js`, matching `/uploads/complaint/:id/attachment`.
- ✅ Dashboard utilities centralized in `client/lib` and imported by dashboard screens.
- ⚠️ `/api/auth/refresh` remains unimplemented on the backend; the RTK Query mutation is currently unused.
- ⚠️ Legacy Redux thunks (complaints, guest) still backfill several dashboards.
- ⚠️ Dormant helper components remain in the tree pending cleanup.
- ⚠️ `npm run typecheck` continues to fail because of pre-existing TypeScript issues.
