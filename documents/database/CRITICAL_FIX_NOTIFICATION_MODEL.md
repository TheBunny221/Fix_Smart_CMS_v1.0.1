# Critical Fix: Missing Notification Model

## Issue Identified
The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createMany')` was occurring because:

1. **Controllers were using notification operations** like `prisma.notification.createMany()`
2. **Notification model was missing** from the Prisma schema
3. **Server couldn't find the notification table** definition

## Root Cause
During the schema cleanup, the Notification model was accidentally omitted from the production schema, but the controllers still had code that relied on it for:
- Creating notifications when complaints are assigned
- Notifying ward officers of new complaints
- Bulk notification creation

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added Missing Notification Model
```prisma
model Notification {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String
  complaintId String?
  type        String   @default("IN_APP") // IN_APP, EMAIL, SMS
  title       String
  message     String
  isRead      Boolean  @default(false)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  // Relations
  user      User       @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  complaint Complaint? @relation(fields: [complaintId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)

  @@index([userId, isRead])
  @@index([createdAt])
  @@index([complaintId])
  @@map("notifications")
}
```

### 2. Added Relations to Existing Models
- **User model**: Added `notifications Notification[]` relation
- **Complaint model**: Added `notifications Notification[]` relation

### 3. Schema Validation
- ‚úÖ `npx prisma validate` - Schema is now valid
- ‚úÖ All model references resolved

## Controllers Using Notifications
The following controllers were failing due to the missing model:

1. **ComplaintController** (`server/controller/complaintController.js`)
   - Lines 495, 515, 1596: `prisma.notification.create()` and `createMany()`
   - Used for notifying ward officers of new assignments

2. **GuestController** (`server/controller/guestController.js`)
   - Lines 647, 661: `prisma.notification.create()`
   - Used for guest complaint notifications

3. **GuestServiceRequestController** (`server/controller/guestServiceRequestController.js`)
   - Line 356: `prisma.notification.create()`
   - Used for service request notifications

## Required Actions

### Immediate (to fix the error)
1. **Restart the server** - The new schema needs to be loaded
2. **Run database migration**: `npx prisma db push`
3. **Generate Prisma client**: `npx prisma generate` (when file permissions allow)

### Verification Steps
1. **Test complaint creation** - Should no longer throw the createMany error
2. **Test complaint assignment** - Notifications should be created properly
3. **Check notification functionality** - Verify in-app notifications work

## Impact
- **Before**: Complaint operations were failing with `createMany` error
- **After**: All notification-dependent operations should work normally
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained - existing data unaffected

## Status
‚úÖ **FIXED** - Notification model added to schema
‚è≥ **PENDING** - Server restart and database migration needed
üîÑ **TESTING** - Requires verification of complaint operations

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Fixes runtime errors in complaint management
**Risk**: LOW - Only adds missing functionality, no breaking changes
