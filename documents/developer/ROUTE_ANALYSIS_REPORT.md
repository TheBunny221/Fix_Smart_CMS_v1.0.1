### Commented/Unused Routes (Candidates for Legacy)

#### Guest Routes (Commented but Referenced)
- ❌ `/guest/complaint` - **USED** in navigation but route commented
- ❌ `/complaint` - **USED** in navigation but route commented  
- ❌ `/guest/service-request` - **USED** in navigation but route commented

#### Complaint Management Routes (Commented but Some Referenced)
- ❌ `/complaints/create` - Route commented, no active usage found
- ❌ `/complaints/citizen-form` - **USED** in CitizenDashboard navigation but route commented
- ❌ `/complaints/new` - Route commented, no active usage found

#### Communication & Settings Routes (Commented but Referenced)
- ❌ `/messages` - **USED** in navigation components but route commented
- ❌ `/settings` - **USED** in navigation components but route commented

### Unused Page Components (No Routes)

#### Legacy Dashboard Components
- 📄 `AdminAnalytics.tsx` - No route, replaced by UnifiedReports
- 📄 `AdminReports.tsx` - No route, replaced by UnifiedReports  
- 📄 `ReportsAnalytics.tsx` - No route, replaced by UnifiedReports
- 📄 `AdminWardBoundaries.tsx` - No route, functionality moved to AdminConfig
- 📄 `TokenClearHelper.tsx` - No route, utility component
- 📄 `NotFound.tsx` - No route defined (should have one)

#### Commented Import Components (Have Routes but Imports Commented)
- 📄 `CitizenDashboard.tsx` - Import commented, replaced by RoleBasedDashboard
- 📄 `WardOfficerDashboard.tsx` - Import commented, replaced by RoleBasedDashboard
- 📄 `MaintenanceDashboard.tsx` - Import commented, replaced by RoleBasedDashboard
- 📄 `AdminDashboard.tsx` - Import commented, replaced by RoleBasedDashboard

### Issues Identified

#### 1. Route-Navigation Mismatch
Several routes are commented out but still referenced in navigation:
- `/guest/complaint` - Used in Index.tsx, Login.tsx, Register.tsx, GuestDashboard.tsx
- `/complaint` - Used in Index.tsx, Navigation.tsx
- `/guest/service-request` - Used in GuestDashboard.tsx
- `/complaints/citizen-form` - Used in CitizenDashboard.tsx
- `/messages` - Used in navigation components
- `/settings` - Used in navigation components

#### 2. Unused Import Warning
- `Messages` component is imported but never used (TypeScript warning)

#### 3. Password Reset Route Verification
- ✅ Routes `/set-password/:token` and `/set-password` are properly configured
- ✅ Component handles both URL parameter and query parameter tokens
- ✅ Backend integration appears correct

#### 4. Missing Routes
- `NotFound.tsx` component exists but no 404 route is defined

## Recommendations

### Phase 1: Fix Route-Navigation Mismatches
1. **Uncomment and activate essential guest routes:**
   - `/guest/complaint` → `GuestComplaintForm`
   - `/complaint` → `QuickComplaintPage` 
   - `/guest/service-request` → `GuestServiceRequest`

2. **Uncomment essential user routes:**
   - `/settings` → `Settings`
   - `/messages` → `Messages`

### Phase 2: Move Unused Components to Legacy
1. **Move replaced analytics components:**
   - `AdminAnalytics.tsx`
   - `AdminReports.tsx`
   - `ReportsAnalytics.tsx`

2. **Move replaced dashboard components:**
   - `CitizenDashboard.tsx`
   - `WardOfficerDashboard.tsx`
   - `MaintenanceDashboard.tsx`
   - `AdminDashboard.tsx`

3. **Move unused utility components:**
   - `TokenClearHelper.tsx`
   - `AdminWardBoundaries.tsx`

### Phase 3: Clean Up Imports
1. Remove unused `Messages` import from App.tsx
2. Update component imports after moving to legacy

### Phase 4: Add Missing Routes
1. Add proper 404 route for `NotFound.tsx`

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Breaking Navigation)
- Uncomment `/guest/complaint`, `/complaint`, `/guest/service-request` routes
- Uncomment `/settings` and `/messages` routes

### Medium Priority (Code Cleanup)
- Move unused dashboard components to legacy
- Move unused analytics components to legacy

### Low Priority (Maintenance)
- Clean up unused imports
- Add 404 route
- Update documentation
