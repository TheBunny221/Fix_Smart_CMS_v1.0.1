# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical system configuration integrity issues where the frontend displays default/hardcoded values instead of database-sourced SystemConfig values. The system will implement comprehensive auditing, centralized configuration management, and robust fallback mechanisms to ensure SystemConfig serves as the single source of truth across the entire application stack.

## Glossary

- **SystemConfig**: The database-driven configuration system that stores application settings with isActive flags
- **Configuration Integrity**: The guarantee that frontend displays match database SystemConfig values without silent fallbacks
- **Fallback Chain**: The ordered sequence of configuration sources: DB SystemConfig → seed.json → environment defaults
- **Configuration Audit**: Comprehensive analysis of all configuration usage patterns across frontend and backend
- **Canonical Keys**: The authoritative set of configuration keys without duplicates or redundancy
- **Runtime Configuration**: Configuration values fetched dynamically at application runtime rather than build-time
- **Configuration Propagation**: The process of delivering SystemConfig values from database to frontend components
- **Silent Fallback**: Unlogged fallback to default values when SystemConfig retrieval fails
- **Build-time Injection**: Configuration values embedded into client bundles during build process
- **Configuration Cache**: Server-side caching mechanism for SystemConfig values with invalidation logic

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to identify all root causes why frontend shows default values instead of SystemConfig values, so that I can ensure database configuration is properly displayed to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration Audit SHALL identify all frontend components that display hardcoded or default values instead of SystemConfig values
2. THE Configuration Audit SHALL trace the complete data flow from database SystemConfig to frontend display components
3. THE Configuration Audit SHALL detect any build-time configuration injection that overrides runtime SystemConfig values
4. THE Configuration Audit SHALL identify all API endpoints and middleware that should deliver SystemConfig to frontend
5. THE Configuration Audit SHALL document all silent fallback mechanisms that bypass SystemConfig without logging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want SystemConfig values to be fetched, cached, and delivered to frontend reliably on startup and runtime, so that users see the correct application branding and configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SystemConfig Service SHALL fetch configuration from database with proper error handling and logging
2. THE SystemConfig API SHALL deliver all active configuration keys to frontend with consistent response format
3. THE Frontend Configuration Manager SHALL request SystemConfig on application initialization and cache values appropriately
4. THE Configuration Cache SHALL invalidate and refresh when SystemConfig values change in database
5. THE SystemConfig Propagation SHALL work consistently across multiple concurrent users without race conditions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to eliminate redundant and duplicate system config keys, so that there is a single canonical source for each configuration value.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration Audit SHALL identify all duplicate keys across database, seed.json, and environment files
2. THE Canonical Key Mapping SHALL consolidate redundant keys into single authoritative keys with clear naming
3. THE Legacy Key Support SHALL maintain backward compatibility during transition period with deprecation logging
4. THE Configuration Migration SHALL update all code references to use canonical keys only
5. THE Seed Configuration SHALL contain only canonical keys with deprecated keys marked for removal

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to ensure each environment file is used properly without silent overrides, so that configuration behaves predictably across development, staging, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Environment Validation SHALL verify all .env file variants contain required keys and no unused keys
2. THE Configuration Loading SHALL use the correct .env file based on NODE_ENV without runtime overrides
3. THE Build Process SHALL document which environment file is used for each build target
4. THE Environment Override Detection SHALL identify and log any runtime modifications to process.env values
5. THE Configuration Consistency SHALL ensure build scripts set NODE_ENV correctly for target environment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging when fallbacks occur and when SystemConfig values are applied, so that I can monitor configuration behavior and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SystemConfig Service SHALL log all fallback events with severity level and context information
2. THE Configuration Logger SHALL record which keys are loaded from database versus seed.json versus environment defaults
3. THE Frontend Configuration SHALL log successful SystemConfig loading with key counts and source information
4. THE Fallback Detection SHALL alert when silent fallbacks occur without proper error handling
5. THE Configuration Monitoring SHALL track SystemConfig API response times and failure rates

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized configuration utilities that source SystemConfig from API, so that components read configuration consistently without direct process.env access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration Utility SHALL provide a single interface for accessing all SystemConfig values in frontend
2. THE Component Configuration SHALL read app name, branding, and settings only through centralized utilities
3. THE Configuration Fallback SHALL display clear indicators when SystemConfig is missing with appropriate logging
4. THE Runtime Configuration SHALL fetch SystemConfig dynamically rather than relying on build-time injection
5. THE Configuration Interface SHALL expose getters for all canonical configuration keys with type safety

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want automated tests that verify SystemConfig propagation from database to frontend display, so that configuration integrity is maintained across releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API Tests SHALL verify SystemConfig endpoint returns correct database values with proper filtering
2. THE Integration Tests SHALL confirm frontend displays database-sourced app name and branding in UI components
3. THE Configuration Tests SHALL validate fallback behavior when database is unavailable
4. THE Build Tests SHALL ensure production builds do not contain baked-in default strings
5. THE Load Tests SHALL verify SystemConfig consistency under concurrent user access

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a comprehensive remediation plan with specific patches, so that I can fix all code paths that ignore SystemConfig and ensure database values are displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Remediation Plan SHALL provide specific file paths and code modifications for backend SystemConfig fixes
2. THE Frontend Patches SHALL refactor components to use centralized configuration utilities exclusively
3. THE Build Configuration SHALL update scripts to support runtime SystemConfig fetching over build-time injection
4. THE Migration Strategy SHALL consolidate duplicate keys with backward compatibility during transition
5. THE Verification Plan SHALL include manual QA steps and automated tests to confirm SystemConfig integrity
