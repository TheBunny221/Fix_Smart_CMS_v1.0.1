# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a comprehensive production hardening and security analysis project. The system shall undergo thorough vulnerability assessment, deployment standardization, and production-readiness modifications while preserving existing functionality and avoiding new feature development.

## Glossary

- **System**: The complete React + Node.js + Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL application stack
- **Vulnerability_Scanner**: Automated tools for identifying security risks in dependencies and code patterns
- **PM2_Manager**: Process management system for Node.js applications in production environments
- **RBAC_Controller**: Role-Based Access Control enforcement mechanisms
- **Prisma_Client**: Database ORM client for PostgreSQL operations
- **Apache_Proxy**: Reverse proxy server configuration for production deployment
- **I18n_System**: Internationalization framework for multi-language support
- **Export_Generator**: System component responsible for generating data exports
- **Multi_OS_Deployment**: Cross-platform deployment capability for Linux Debian and Windows Server

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive security vulnerability analysis, so that I can identify and remediate critical security risks before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Vulnerability_Scanner executes static analysis, THE System SHALL identify all critical, high, medium, and low security risks in both frontend and backend code
2. WHEN dependency analysis runs, THE System SHALL generate a complete list of vulnerable packages with version information and remediation steps
3. WHEN code pattern analysis executes, THE System SHALL detect unsafe SQL queries, unsanitized inputs, hardcoded secrets, and exposed debug endpoints
4. THE System SHALL produce a vulnerability report in both JSON and markdown formats with file locations and line numbers
5. THE System SHALL categorize each vulnerability by severity level with specific remediation recommendations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want standardized multi-OS deployment configurations, so that the application can be reliably deployed on both Linux Debian and Windows Server environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment scripts execute on Linux Debian, THE System SHALL start successfully using PM2_Manager with proper environment configuration
2. WHEN deployment scripts execute on Windows Server, THE System SHALL start successfully using PM2_Manager with proper environment configuration
3. THE System SHALL provide Apache_Proxy configuration examples with SSL termination capabilities
4. THE System SHALL bind to configurable host and port settings from environment variables
5. THE System SHALL include startup scripts for both systemd (Linux) and Windows Service/Task Scheduler

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want Prisma and PostgreSQL configurations hardened for production, so that database operations are secure, performant, and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Prisma_Client SHALL use production-appropriate connection pool settings with configurable limits
2. WHEN Prisma validation runs, THE System SHALL pass all schema validation checks without errors
3. THE System SHALL use parameterized queries exclusively, preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities
4. WHEN migrations execute in production mode, THE System SHALL complete successfully without data loss
5. THE System SHALL replace any invalid groupBy operations with supported Prisma patterns or raw SQL

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want server-side RBAC enforcement on all protected routes, so that authorization cannot be bypassed through client-side manipulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any protected API endpoint receives a request, THE RBAC_Controller SHALL verify user permissions server-side before processing
2. THE System SHALL sanitize all external inputs using validation schemas before database operations
3. WHEN authentication endpoints receive requests, THE System SHALL apply rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
4. THE System SHALL return generic error messages in production while logging detailed errors securely
5. WHEN CORS requests are made, THE System SHALL enforce strict origin policies appropriate for production

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an end user, I want complete internationalization support across all pages, so that I can use the application in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN language switching occurs, THE I18n_System SHALL update all user-facing text using existing translation files
2. THE System SHALL identify and document all missing translation keys with fallback to default locale
3. WHEN pages load, THE System SHALL display translated content based on user language preference
4. THE I18n_System SHALL work consistently across all existing pages without requiring new UI components
5. THE System SHALL maintain language preference across user sessions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want reliable export functionality that works under concurrent usage, so that multiple users can generate reports simultaneously without data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users request exports simultaneously, THE Export_Generator SHALL produce complete, non-blank files for each user
2. THE System SHALL apply RBAC_Controller checks server-side for all export data access
3. WHEN export generation fails, THE System SHALL display appropriate error messages to users
4. THE Export_Generator SHALL include all required templates and assets in production builds
5. WHEN exports complete successfully, THE System SHALL provide confirmation feedback to users

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want organized documentation structure, so that deployment guides, troubleshooting steps, and system information are easily accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL move all root-level markdown files into appropriate documents/ subdirectories
2. WHEN documentation reorganization completes, THE System SHALL provide updated README files in each documents/ folder
3. THE System SHALL maintain a log of removed or relocated documentation files
4. THE System SHALL include a comprehensive production deployment checklist
5. THE System SHALL provide rollback procedures and environment variable documentation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want automated verification scripts, so that I can quickly validate system functionality after deployment or updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN smoke tests execute, THE System SHALL verify health endpoints return successful responses
2. THE System SHALL validate basic API functionality including authentication, reports, and exports
3. WHEN manual verification checklist runs, THE System SHALL confirm RBAC enforcement, export content integrity, and i18n functionality
4. THE System SHALL test PM2_Manager restart behavior and process stability
5. THE System SHALL verify build outputs include all necessary assets and configurations
