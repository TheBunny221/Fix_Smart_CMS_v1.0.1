# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on achieving complete internationalization (i18n) coverage across all user-accessible UI pages while simultaneously cleaning up redundant system configuration settings. The system supports multiple user roles (ADMIN, WARD_OFFICER, MAINTENANCE, CITIZEN) and must ensure all visible text elements are properly localized using the existing i18n framework. Additionally, the admin system settings page requires cleanup to remove unused or duplicate configuration keys, with corresponding updates to the seed file to maintain data consistency.

## Glossary

- **UI_Localization_System**: The existing i18n framework that manages translation keys and language switching functionality
- **System_Configuration_Manager**: The admin interface component that manages system-wide configuration settings
- **Translation_Key**: A unique identifier used to reference localized text strings (e.g., t('dashboard.title'))
- **Seed_File**: The JSON file containing default system configuration data used during application initialization
- **Role_Based_Access**: The system's user permission structure that determines which UI components are accessible to different user types
- **Hardcoded_String**: Text values directly embedded in component code rather than using translation keys

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all UI text elements to use translation keys instead of hardcoded strings, so that the application can support multiple languages consistently across all user roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI_Localization_System loads any page accessible to any role, THE UI_Localization_System SHALL display all text elements using translation keys rather than hardcoded strings
2. WHILE a user navigates through role-specific pages, THE UI_Localization_System SHALL maintain consistent translation key naming patterns following the existing structure
3. WHERE translation keys are missing for existing text elements, THE UI_Localization_System SHALL provide fallback values to prevent display errors
4. THE UI_Localization_System SHALL support all existing languages (English, Hindi, Malayalam) with updated translation files
5. WHEN developers add new UI text elements, THE UI_Localization_System SHALL enforce the use of translation keys through proper useTranslation() hook implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive audit report of translation coverage by user role, so that I can identify and address any remaining localization gaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE UI_Localization_System SHALL generate a role-wise audit report documenting all accessible pages and their translation status
2. WHEN the audit process executes, THE UI_Localization_System SHALL identify all visible text elements including labels, buttons, headings, messages, tooltips, and notifications
3. THE UI_Localization_System SHALL document which translation keys were added and which text elements remain untranslated
4. WHERE translation keys are mismatched or use incorrect namespace patterns, THE UI_Localization_System SHALL report these inconsistencies
5. THE UI_Localization_System SHALL provide the audit report in both JSON and Markdown formats for developer reference

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the admin system settings page to contain only relevant and active configuration fields, so that the interface is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System_Configuration_Manager SHALL display only configuration fields that are actively used in the current system
2. WHEN administrators access the system settings page, THE System_Configuration_Manager SHALL not show unused, duplicate, or legacy configuration keys
3. THE System_Configuration_Manager SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing configuration references in other system components
4. WHERE configuration keys are removed from the UI, THE System_Configuration_Manager SHALL ensure corresponding backend and Redux state references are updated
5. THE System_Configuration_Manager SHALL preserve the current UI layout and functionality while removing obsolete fields

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the seed file to be synchronized with the cleaned system configuration structure, so that initial system setup uses only valid configuration data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Seed_File SHALL contain only configuration keys that are actively used and displayed in the System_Configuration_Manager
2. WHEN the system initializes with seed data, THE Seed_File SHALL not include obsolete or unused configuration entries
3. THE Seed_File SHALL maintain schema consistency with the cleaned configuration structure
4. WHERE configuration keys are removed from the system, THE Seed_File SHALL be updated to reflect these changes
5. THE Seed_File SHALL validate successfully and run without missing key errors after cleanup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation of all identified system issues and broken features, so that future maintenance and improvements can be prioritized effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE UI_Localization_System SHALL create a comprehensive problem and broken feature documentation
2. WHEN system issues are identified during the audit process, THE UI_Localization_System SHALL categorize them by severity, affected roles, and potential fixes
3. THE UI_Localization_System SHALL include timestamps and developer reference information for each documented issue
4. THE UI_Localization_System SHALL organize the documentation in the documents/ folder following the established structure
5. WHERE bugs or feature inconsistencies are found, THE UI_Localization_System SHALL provide sufficient detail for debugging and resolution planning
