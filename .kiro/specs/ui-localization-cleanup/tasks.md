    - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2_

  - [x] 2.2 Build translation key validation system

    - Scan existing translation files (en.json, hi.json, ml.json) to catalog current keys
    - Identify missing translation keys and namespace inconsistencies across components
    - Validate useTranslation() hook usage and import statements in components
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.4_

  - [x] 2.3 Generate comprehensive audit report

    - Create role-wise audit matrix showing translation coverage by user role and page
    - Output audit results in both JSON and Markdown formats for developer reference
    - Include statistics on translation coverage percentages and identified issues
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Implement systematic translation key replacement

  - [x] 3.1 Replace hardcoded strings with translation keys

    - Update React components to use translation keys following existing naming patterns
    - Ensure proper useTranslation() hook implementation in all modified components
    - Maintain consistent translation key structure (e.g., 'dashboard.title', 'complaints.status.pending')
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

  - [x] 3.2 Update translation files for all supported languages

    - Add new translation keys to en.json, hi.json, and ml.json files
    - Provide English translations for all new keys and leave other languages blank where untranslated
    - Ensure translation file structure remains consistent across all language files
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.3_

  - [x] 3.3 Validate translation integration

    - Test component rendering with new translation keys to ensure no display errors
    - Verify fallback behavior when translation keys are missing
    - Check language switching functionality works correctly with updated keys
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.5_

- [x] 4. Implement system configuration cleanup


  - [x] 4.1 Analyze current system configuration usage

    - Scan SystemSettingsManager component and related files to identify all configuration fields
    - Cross-reference configuration keys with their usage in other components and backend code
    - Create mapping of active vs unused configuration keys based on actual system usage
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.4_

  - [x] 4.2 Remove unused configuration fields from admin UI

    - Update SystemSettingsManager component to hide or remove unused configuration inputs
    - Ensure remaining configuration fields maintain their current functionality and layout
    - Update Redux state slices to remove references to obsolete configuration keys
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

  - [x] 4.3 Update backend configuration references

    - Review server-side code for references to removed configuration keys
    - Update or remove backend logic that depends on cleaned configuration fields
    - Ensure API endpoints continue to work with the cleaned configuration structure
    - _Requirements: 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 5. Synchronize seed file with cleaned configuration






  - [x] 5.1 Update seed.json with valid configuration keys only



    - Remove obsolete configuration entries from seed.json that correspond to cleaned UI fields
    - Ensure remaining seed configuration matches the active system configuration structure
    - Validate that all required configuration keys for system initialization are present
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

  - [x] 5.2 Test seed file validation and system initialization



    - Run seed file validation to ensure schema consistency and no missing key errors
    - Test complete system initialization process with updated seed data
    - Verify that all system functionality works correctly with cleaned seed configuration
    - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 6. Generate comprehensive issue documentation

  - [ ] 6.1 Create problem and broken feature documentation

    - Document all identified system issues, bugs, and feature inconsistencies found during audit
    - Categorize issues by severity level, affected user roles, and potential impact
    - Include file locations, error descriptions, and suggested remediation steps for each issue
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_

  - [ ] 6.2 Organize documentation in established structure

    - Create problem-and-broken-features.md file in documents/ folder following project conventions
    - Include timestamps, developer reference information, and priority levels for each documented issue
    - Provide sufficient technical detail for future debugging and resolution planning
    - _Requirements: 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 7. Perform comprehensive system validation

  - [ ] 7.1 Validate translation coverage and functionality

    - Test all user roles to ensure proper translation key usage across accessible pages
    - Verify language switching works correctly and no hardcoded strings remain visible
    - Check that all UI text elements display properly with translation keys
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

  - [ ] 7.2 Validate system configuration integrity

    - Test admin system settings page to ensure only relevant fields are displayed
    - Verify that configuration changes save and load correctly with cleaned structure
    - Confirm that system functionality is preserved after configuration cleanup
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

  - [ ] 7.3 Validate seed file and system initialization

    - Test complete system startup process with updated seed file
    - Verify all system components initialize correctly with cleaned configuration data
    - Ensure no missing configuration key errors occur during system operation
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.5_
