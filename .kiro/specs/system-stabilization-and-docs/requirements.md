# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature encompasses a comprehensive modernization and stabilization effort for the entire project architecture to achieve production-grade deployment readiness across multi-OS environments. The system will implement robust SystemConfig fallback logic, centralized configuration management, cross-platform deployment capabilities, and structured documentation organization for long-term maintainability and developer onboarding.

## Glossary

- **SystemConfig**: The centralized configuration system that manages application settings with database-first approach and seed.json fallback
- **Fallback Logic**: The mechanism that retrieves configuration from seed.json when database values are unavailable
- **Production Environment**: Live deployment environment with HTTPS, reverse proxy, and process management
- **Cross-Platform Deployment**: Deployment capability across Linux and Windows operating systems
- **Reverse Proxy**: Apache or Nginx server that handles SSL termination and request forwarding
- **PM2**: Process manager for Node.js applications providing clustering and monitoring
- **Documentation Structure**: Organized markdown files under /docs with modular, interlinked content
- **Environment Validation**: Startup checks for required environment variables and configuration consistency

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable configuration management with automatic fallback, so that the application remains functional even when database configuration is unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SystemConfig database table is unavailable or empty, THE SystemConfig SHALL retrieve configuration values from seed.json
2. WHEN fallback occurs, THE SystemConfig SHALL log an info-level message indicating fallback usage for traceability
3. THE SystemConfig SHALL prioritize database values over seed.json values when both are available
4. THE SystemConfig SHALL provide consistent configuration access across frontend and backend components
5. THE SystemConfig SHALL validate configuration completeness at application startup

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized and dynamic configuration usage throughout the application, so that configuration changes are reflected consistently without hardcoded values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Frontend SHALL read all configuration values (API URLs, App Title, Complaint Prefix) dynamically from centralized utilities
2. THE Backend SHALL access configuration through the SystemConfig service without direct database queries
3. THE SystemConfig SHALL expose a unified interface for configuration access across all application layers
4. THE SystemConfig SHALL support runtime configuration updates without application restart
5. THE SystemConfig SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing configuration usage patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want validated environment configuration and cross-platform deployment support, so that the application can be deployed reliably on Linux and Windows with proper process management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL validate all required environment variables at startup and warn about missing or unused variables
2. THE Deployment System SHALL support Linux and Windows operating systems with identical functionality
3. THE Application SHALL integrate with Apache and Nginx reverse proxies for HTTPS/SSL termination
4. THE Process Manager SHALL use PM2 ecosystem configuration for managing frontend and backend processes
5. THE Deployment System SHALL enforce HTTPS redirection through reverse proxy configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured and comprehensive documentation organized by domain, so that I can quickly find relevant information for development, deployment, and maintenance tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL organize all documentation under /docs with modular markdown files
2. THE Documentation Structure SHALL include deployment, database, client, server, onboarding, and release sections
3. THE Documentation SHALL provide index navigation with valid links between related sections
4. THE Documentation System SHALL remove outdated and redundant documentation files from root and legacy locations
5. THE Documentation SHALL render cleanly in GitHub and internal documentation viewers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want comprehensive onboarding documentation and development guidelines, so that I can set up the development environment and understand project conventions quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Onboarding Documentation SHALL provide setup instructions for Linux, macOS, and Windows environments
2. THE Development Guidelines SHALL include Git workflow, branching conventions, and commit message standards
3. THE Documentation SHALL include debugging guides and troubleshooting steps for common issues
4. THE Best Practices Documentation SHALL cover secure development standards and code quality guidelines
5. THE Tool Recommendations SHALL include IDE setup, extensions, and development tools configuration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can track system behavior, configuration usage, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Logging System SHALL use Winston or Pino for structured logging across the application
2. THE SystemConfig SHALL log all fallback occurrences with sufficient context for debugging
3. THE Application SHALL log environment validation results and configuration loading status
4. THE Logging Configuration SHALL support different log levels for development and production environments
5. THE Monitoring System SHALL integrate with PM2 for process health and performance tracking

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want automated service configuration and process management, so that the application runs reliably in production with proper restart capabilities and monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Service Configuration SHALL provide systemd service files for Linux environments
2. THE Service Configuration SHALL support NSSM or Node Windows Service for Windows environments
3. THE PM2 Configuration SHALL handle automatic restarts on application crashes
4. THE Process Management SHALL support clustering and load balancing for high availability
5. THE Service Management SHALL integrate with system startup and shutdown procedures
