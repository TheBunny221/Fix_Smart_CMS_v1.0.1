# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature encompasses a comprehensive project-wide internationalization (i18n) audit and conversion, redundant file cleanup, and complete documentation restructuring with interlinked navigation system. The system will ensure every user-facing string across all roles (Admin, Ward Officer, Maintenance Team, Citizen) uses proper i18n translation keys, remove outdated files and scripts, and establish a well-structured documentation hierarchy with cross-linked index files for seamless navigation across departments.

## Glossary

- **I18n_System**: The existing internationalization framework that manages translation keys and language switching functionality across the application
- **User_Role_Coverage**: Complete translation coverage for all user roles including Admin Panel, Ward Officer Dashboard, Maintenance Team Portal, and Citizen Portal
- **Hardcoded_String**: Any user-facing text directly embedded in code rather than using translation keys
- **Legacy_Documentation**: Outdated markdown files and documentation scattered throughout the project root and various directories
- **Documentation_Hierarchy**: Structured organization of documentation under /docs with departmental folders and interlinked index files
- **Cross_Linking_System**: Navigation system that connects related documentation across different departments and sections
- **Redundant_Scripts**: Unused, outdated, or duplicate scripts in root directory and /scripts folder that should be removed or archived

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

3. THE I18n_System SHALL localize toast/snackbar messages and in-app notifications for all user interactions
4. THE I18n_System SHALL ensure server response messages, email subjects, validation messages, and user notifications use standardized i18n key mappings
5. THE I18n_System SHALL maintain consistent translation key naming patterns following the existing structure across all roles and components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive role-based translation coverage documentation, so that I can verify complete i18n implementation across all user interfaces and identify any remaining gaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE I18n_System SHALL generate a complete audit report documenting translation coverage for Admin Panel, Ward Officer Dashboard, Maintenance Team Portal, and Citizen Portal
2. THE I18n_System SHALL identify and document all visible text elements including labels, buttons, headings, messages, tooltips, notifications, and server responses by role
3. THE I18n_System SHALL provide detailed mapping of which translation keys were added and which text elements were converted from hardcoded strings
4. THE I18n_System SHALL validate translation key consistency and namespace patterns across all roles and components
5. THE I18n_System SHALL ensure all supported languages (English, Hindi, Malayalam) have updated translation files with new keys

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all redundant and outdated files removed from the project, so that the codebase is clean and only contains actively used components and scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Project_Cleanup_System SHALL identify and remove all redundant or outdated markdown files from the root directory
2. THE Project_Cleanup_System SHALL remove unused or duplicate scripts from the root directory and /scripts folder
3. THE Project_Cleanup_System SHALL move all existing legacy documentation to docs/legacy-doc/ with proper organization
4. THE Project_Cleanup_System SHALL preserve folder hierarchy in the legacy archive and add a comprehensive README.md listing all archived files with reasons for archival
5. THE Project_Cleanup_System SHALL ensure no actively used files or scripts are removed during the cleanup process

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer or team member, I want a well-structured documentation system with clear departmental organization, so that I can quickly find relevant information for my specific role and responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation_Hierarchy SHALL create a new structure under /docs with subfolders for QA, Developer, Onboarding, System, Database, and Deployment

4. THE Documentation_Hierarchy SHALL ensure all documentation renders correctly on GitHub and internal documentation viewers
5. THE Documentation_Hierarchy SHALL organize content logically within each department with clear naming conventions and consistent structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user navigating the documentation, I want seamless cross-linking between related documents across departments, so that I can easily find related information without having to search through multiple sections manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cross_Linking_System SHALL implement a root docs/README.md that acts as a global documentation map linking all departmental indexes
2. THE Cross_Linking_System SHALL include "See Also" sections in every document linking to related documents in other departments
3. THE Cross_Linking_System SHALL use relative links (e.g., ../Developer/README.md) to ensure compatibility with GitHub and internal viewers
4. THE Cross_Linking_System SHALL establish logical cross-references between QA ↔ Developer, Deployment ↔ System, Database ↔ Developer, and other related sections
5. THE Cross_Linking_System SHALL validate all internal links to ensure they work correctly and point to existing documents

### Requirement 6
