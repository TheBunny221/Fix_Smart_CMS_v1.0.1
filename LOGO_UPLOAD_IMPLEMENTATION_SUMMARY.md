# Dynamic Logo Upload Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The dynamic app logo rendering and upload feature has been successfully integrated using the existing upload API. Here's what was implemented:

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Application Branding Section in SystemSettingsManager
- **Location**: `client/components/SystemSettingsManager.tsx`
- **New Section**: "Application Branding" with logo upload functionality
- **Features**:
  - Current logo display with fallback
  - File input for PNG, JPG, SVG uploads (max 2MB)
  - Live preview before upload
  - Upload progress indicator
  - Success/error toast notifications

### 2. Dynamic Logo Rendering in AppHeader
- **Location**: `client/components/ui/logo.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic detection of uploaded logo at `/uploads/logo.png`
  - Fallback hierarchy: Custom URL → Uploaded Logo → Default Logo → Icon
  - Error handling with graceful fallbacks
  - Real-time logo updates without page reload

### 3. Server-Side Logo Upload Handler
- **Location**: `server/controller/uploadController.js`
- **Features**:
  - Uses existing upload API endpoint: `POST /api/uploads/logo`
  - Admin-only access restriction
  - File validation (type, size)
  - Automatic file replacement as `logo.png`
  - System config update for `APP_LOGO_URL`

### 4. Static File Serving
- **Location**: `server/app.js`
- **Feature**: Uploads directory served statically at `/uploads/`
- **Access**: Direct access to uploaded logo at `/uploads/logo.png`

### 5. System Configuration Integration
- **Location**: `client/contexts/SystemConfigContext.tsx`
- **Feature**: Automatic config refresh after logo upload
- **Benefit**: Live UI updates without page reload

### Testing

2. `LOGO_UPLOAD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Upload Flow
1. Admin selects logo file in SystemSettingsManager
2. Client validates file type and size
3. FormData sent to `/api/uploads/logo` endpoint
4. Server validates and saves file as `/uploads/logo.png`
5. System config `APP_LOGO_URL` updated to `/uploads/logo.png`
6. Client refreshes system config context
7. Logo component detects new logo and updates UI

### Fallback Strategy
1. **Primary**: Configured `APP_LOGO_URL` from system settings
2. **Secondary**: Check for `/uploads/logo.png` (uploaded logo)
3. **Tertiary**: Default `/logo.png` from public directory
4. **Final**: Fallback icon (Shield icon)

### Security Features
- Admin-only upload access via JWT authentication
- File type validation (PNG, JPG, SVG only)
- File size limit (2MB maximum)
- Automatic file replacement prevents accumulation

## 🎨 User Experience Features

## 🔍 Validation & Error Handling

### Client-Side Validation

- File size validation (2MB limit)
- User-friendly error messages
- Upload state management

### Server-Side Validation
- Duplicate file type validation
